## 📖 Overview

**TruthChain** is a next-generation truth-detection platform that merges **Semantic AI** with **Web3 Immutability**.

In an era of deepfakes, clickbait, and silent retroactive editing, the "truth" is becoming increasingly malleable. TruthChain solves this by creating a two-step verification layer:
1.  **The Brain (AI):** A Semantic NLP engine analyzes incoming news for stance, bias, and consistency.
2.  **The Vault (Blockchain):** The content and its "Truth Score" are minted to the Ethereum blockchain, making them permanently unchangeable and censorship-resistant.

## 💡 The Dual-Layer Solution

| Problem (Web2) | TruthChain Solution (AI + Web3) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fake News & Clickbait** | **Semantic NLP Analysis:** We use Transformer models (BERT/RoBERTa) to detect sensationalism and verify if headlines match the content. |
| **Silent Retro-Editing** | **Immutable Ledger:** Once published, the news entry is locked in a Smart Contract. It cannot be deleted or edited by anyone. |
| **Centralized Censorship** | **Decentralized Storage:** The data lives on the distributed ledger, not on a corporate server that can be wiped. |

## 🚀 Key Features

* **🤖 AI Stance Detection:** Automatically flags articles where the headline contradicts the body text (Clickbait detection).
* **⚖️ Bias Scoring:** The NLP engine assigns a "Neutrality Score" to potential news pieces before they are published.
* **🔒 Tamper-Proof History:** Every article gets a cryptographic hash and timestamp. History is preserved exactly as it was written.
* **💸 Crypto-Economic Incentives:** (Roadmap) Users pay gas fees to publish, reducing spam, while fact-checkers earn tokens for verifying complex stories.
